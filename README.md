Abstract - This document describes the room impulse response processing of a software developed for calculating the acoustical parameters EDT, T20, T30, C50, C80, IACC and IACCearly, according to ISO3382. In addition, transition time (Tt) is calculated, allowing to calculate EDTt, CTt and IACCt, and giving an approach of early sound field behavior. Calculations can be made for octave or third octave bands, according to IEC-61260 filters specifications. Also multiple RIRs can be processed, allowing the user to analyse the averaged or the individual measurements. The software developed is compared with commercial softwares EASERA, Aurora and AARAE, showing good and consistent results. The code is written in Python language and published online.
